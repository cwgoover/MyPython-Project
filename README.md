This is my python project which stores all my python scripts, and most of all is about text processor. And here is some more detailed information about the scripts I have written.

I do not consider myself a programmer, I create these little programs as experiments to have a play with the language, or to solve a problem for myself.  I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve the code and make it more efficient, or simplify the code.

- `1.combine_twofiles_into_table.py` - This will combine two files which is generated by the adb command into one table.

- `2.parse_vmstat_data.py` - parse the result of the 'adb shell vmstat', output: the draw cylinder for key item and draw 2D linear

- `3.WordFrequencyChart.py` - It comes from stackoverflow.com, and it's the best sample with python for "Build an ASCII chart of the most commonly used words in a given text"

- `4. parse_meminfo.py` - parse result of 'adb shell dumpsys meminfo', output: the excel. The usage can be found in 'parse_meminfo -h'

- `5.format_tabular_output.py` - It comes from stackoverflow.com, a sample about how to print format tabular in the txt file.
